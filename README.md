## [Rabbit And Carrot](https://github.com/onurrtosunn/Python-Exercises/blob/main/Rabbit-and-Carrot/rabbit_and_carrot.py)

- An open scene will appear where a carrot moves randomly at a certain angle and speed.
- Control the rabbit using your mouse cursor. The cursor will represent the rabbit.
- Your goal is to move the rabbit to catch the falling carrot by hovering the cursor over it.
- If a carrot hits the edge of the screen, it will bounce off in a different direction.
- When you catch a carrot, your score increases, and your total score is displayed in the corner of the screen.
- A new carrot will spawn in a random location with a random speed and direction every time you catch one.
